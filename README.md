# Cryptocurrencies
# Summary on the purpose of the project:
in this project we used Unsupervised Machine learning when there is no known output ,so baiscally what we did is process data for an unsupervised  model,use clustering and k-means algorthims and use princple component analysis ,so for me and my bestfriend Martha always dreamed about changing the world so when she gets the chance to pitch an envesment in cryptocurrencies to her firm accountability accounting i jumped at the chance to help out and because both of us believed in changing the world this is what cryptocurrency is all about ,so after to he jump in the prices for crypto that made it unaffordable for many investors ,there are many many cryptocurrencies available at more afordable prices Martha has a data set for crypto currencies and she can analyze it the way she wants .

# what we are trying to accomplish:
we 're trying to offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for Martha's customers ,my main job was to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment
what I used to accomplish this purpose :
1.Preprocessing the Data for PCA.
2.Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA.
3.Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means.
4.Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results.

# Results:
1. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means (elbow curve -plot):
